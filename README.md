# Lemmy Community Crawler

Crawls Lemmy instances, gets a list of communities, then deploys it to GitHub Pages. I made this for [Lemmy Go](https://lemmy.raicuparta.com), my Lemmy browser extension.

[lemmy.raicuparta.com/communities.json](https://lemmy.raicuparta.com/communities.json)

Crawler code shamelessly stolen from [Lemmy Explorer](https://github.com/tgxn/lemmy-explorer), and adapted for my purposes.
